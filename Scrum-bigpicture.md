## 12 Agile priciples 

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.**
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.**
* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.**
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.**
* Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.**
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.**
* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.**
